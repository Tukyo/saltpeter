## Game
**RULES:** Players spawn in a top-down arena with limited ammo reserves, a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. A free-for-all fight commences, and the winner is the last player standing. All losing players choose a random upgrade, making it harder for the winner to maintain their streak.

## Lore

**CURRENT_YEAR:** 2380

**LOCATION:** Unknown *(Somewhere in Andromeda)*

Saltpeter takes place in the future after we have discovered a layer of processing for computers, smaller than microprocessors and nanoprocessors, called picoprocessors.

These electronics are so small that they can be installed between ions and atoms, on molecules and even ionic compounds. This allows us to manipulate the molecule with the processor installed physically on it.

**The entire game takes place in a potassium nitrate ionic compound.**

**Picoboards** are molecular level motherboards. They are powered by “picolinks” - which consist of two "picobatteries" and a P380 connector.

**Picolinks** are installed directly on structural bonds between atoms where connections are made to form molecules. They work similarly to a hydroelectric dam, charging themselves via the electronic potential differences between the bonded atoms like an energy gradient.

Quantum mechanical pico computation powered by bonded energy differentials.

## Tech
Saltpeter does not rely on any engine or codebase. It is written using typescript, javascript, html, and css.

The only external package used is WebSocket for networking.
